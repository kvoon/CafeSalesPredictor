# CafeSalesPredictor

This project was originally undertaken as part of a postgraduate Business Analytics university project, it has been subsequently reviewed and enhanced through a self-revision initiative undertaken by the author.

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook file that contains the code used to perform the EDA and model-building processes and a project report that documents the entire project.  

## Tech Stack
- Python: the EDA and regression model-building processes were done using Python and saved as a Jupyter Notebook.
- SQLite3: was used to load and transform the provided dataset using SQL queries, which was given as an SQLite database.
- Numpy: utilised for its numerical and mathematical operations.
- MatplotLib: used to generate various plots required for the EDA and Assumptions checking process when building a linear regression model.
- Pandas: used to load the dataset into a data frame which made it easier to work with.
- Statsmodels: used to perform OLS Regression hypothesis tests.
- Skit-Learn: used to perform linear regression, calculate the mean squared error to determine model accuracy and split the dataset into training and testing sets.
